# command-line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Create a text file in a specific loaction of interest.

### Step 2: 
On the same location as the text file, create a python program file. 

### Step 3: 
In python Program,with open() and open a text file of txt file

### Step 4:  
using read() and split(), split the lines in the file into a sequence of words.

### Step 5: 
using len() count the number of words in the text file.

### Step 6: 
In command prompt, initiate python followed by program name and text file name to get the output.

## PROGRAM:
```
# program for getting the word count using command line arguments.
# Developed by: Yashvanth K
# Register number:212223240186
fname=input("enter the file name")
num_words=0
with open(fname,'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        words=line.split()
        num_words+=len(words)
print('Number of words: ',num_words)        
```
### OUTPUT:
![Exp 5 1](https://github.com/Muthu-Kumaran-M/command-line-arguments-to-count-word/assets/144979439/a2758bc3-3a74-421a-9431-500ed2176981)

## RESULT:
Thus the program is written to find the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
